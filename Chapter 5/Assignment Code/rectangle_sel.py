# Create main function.
# In the main function, declare the variable length and set to float, then ask the user for the length of the rectangle.
# In the main function, declare the variable width and set to float, then ask the user for the width of the rectangle.
# Create catch all assigning variables perimeter and area, then execute rectfind function and pass both variables length and width to the rectfind function.
# Print "Rectangle area is " and display area value with three decimal spaces and eliminate seperation.
# Print "Rectangle perimeter is " and display perimeter value with the decimal spaces and eliminate seperation.
# Create rectfind function.
# Declare the variable calPerimeter, then use equation (2 * (length + width)), assign result of equation to perimeter variable.
# Declare the variable calArea, then use equation (length * width), assign result of the equation to the perimeter variable.
